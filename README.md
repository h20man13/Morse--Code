# Morse--Code
Java, C++, and Python Morse Code

These are files one can add to transfer an int, string, or char into Morse Code.
The methods in these files are static and every method is as followed: called to_Morse("string,int, or char)
What makes this method of Morse Code Unique is that it uses a tree like structure to construct the dots or dashes of the Morse output.
There is also a Spaces method which can change the display to have spaces or not.
