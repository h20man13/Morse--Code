      C++, and Java Morse Code</font>
    </h1>
        <p>
        These are files one can add to transfer an int, string, or char into Morse Code.<br>
        The methods in these files are static and every method is called as followed -> to_Morse("string,int, or char).<br>
        What makes this method of Morse Code Unique is that it uses a tree like structure to construct the dots or dashes for the Morse           output.<br>
        In otherwords when constructing these files I never had to make an hashtable or arrays to say '(this character)' = '(this dot or  dash)'.<br>
        What inspired me to code this was doing a morse code for arduino where I did what I stated above assigning a charvalue to a dotor dash string.<br>
        I was annoyed because I would forget a dash or a dot somewhere and it would hurt my eyes looking through every microscopic dot or dash.<br>
        I figured there has to be a better way i can do this without typing a single dot or dash.<br>
        There is also a Spaces method which can change the display to have spaces or not.<br>
        The method returns a series of "." and "-" to represent the morse code.<br>
        This can be applicable in many situations from making an arduino light blink to making a speaker beep morse code.<br>
        Eventually I Plan to add more To_Morse methods to allow for unsigned int, long, double, etc.<br>
        I also plan to create the Class in javascript and many other launguages as well.
