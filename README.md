      Java, C++, and Python Morse Code

        <p>
        These are files one can add to transfer an int, string, or char into Morse Code.
        The methods in these files are static and every method is called as followed -> to_Morse("string,int, or char).
        What makes this method of Morse Code Unique is that it uses a tree like structure to construct the dots or dashes for the Morse           output.
        In otherwords when constructing these files I never had to make an hashtable or arrays to say '(this character)' = '(this dot or  dash)'.
        What inspired me to code this was doing a morse code for arduino where I did what I stated above assigning a charvalue to a dotor dash string. 
        I was annoyed because I would forget a dash or a dot somewhere and it would hurt my eyes looking through every microscopic dot or dash. 
        I figured there has to be a better way i can do this without typing a single dot or dash.
        There is also a Spaces method which can change the display to have spaces or not.
        The method returns a series of "." and "-" to represent the morse code.
        This can be applicable in many situations from making an arduino light blink to making a speaker beep morse code.
        Eventually I Plan to add more To_Morse methods to allow for unsigned int, long, double, etc.
        I also plan to create the Class in javascript and many other launguages as well.
